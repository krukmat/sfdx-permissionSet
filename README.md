## The Project Overview

### Set Up the Salesforce DX Project
Our first goal is to set up a developer project which we'll use to modify our application. It starts by cloning the repository. Use the command ...
```
git clone https://github.com/developerforce/sfdx-package-profiles-to-permsets
```
… or ...
```
git clone git@github.com:developerforce/sfdx-package-profiles-to-permsets
```
… to clone the repository. Then, open the directory.
```
cd sfdx-package-profiles-to-permsets
```
### Authorize Dev Hub in your Trailhead Playground
Log into your Dev Hub org.
```
sfdx force:auth:web:login -d -a DevHub
```
Proceed to log in with your dev hub credentials.

If you already have an authorized Dev Hub, set it as the default:
```
sfdx force:config:set defaultdevhubusername=<username|alias>
```
### Create a scratch org
```
sfdx force:org:create -s -f config/project-scratch-def.json
```
### Push the source to your scratch org
```
sfdx force:source:push
```
### Open the scratch org and make some changes.
```
sfdx force:org:open
```
### Pull the changes
```
sfdx force:org:pull
```
### Create a new Package Version
```
sfdx force:package:version:create -p packageName -d force-app -k test1234 --wait 10 -v DevHub
```

After installing the package into a scratch org and testing it out, next you release the package!
```
sfdx force:package:version:promote -p packageName@1.0.0-1 -v DevHub
```
